# Lofi Solar System
***Actually has a Star Wars feeling***

This is an app that I build based on the [original challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f) created by the guys from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) so if you want to try it by your own feel free to tray out this beautiful, creative and fun challenge. :nerd_face:

This is an aplication that shows how to use The React Framework [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and styling every component using the one and only [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Framework to help me develop this app in just... Â¿a week? :thinking:

I used [`Framer Motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to help me make those cool transitions and animations. :scream:
